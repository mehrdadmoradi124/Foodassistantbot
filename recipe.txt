"Recipe""Recipe""To make Persian Ghormeh Sabzi for ten people, start by washing and finely chopping four large bunches of parsley, two large bunches of cilantro, and one large bunch of fenugreek (or substitute with dried fenugreek leaves if fresh is unavailable), then set aside. In a large pot, heat 1/2 cup of vegetable oil over medium heat, add the herbs, and saut\u00e9 them for about 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently until they are dark green and aromatic. Remove the herbs from the pot and set aside. In the same pot, add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and saut\u00e9 four large diced onions until golden brown. Add 2 kg of cubed beef or lamb, browning the meat on all sides. Then, add the saut\u00e9ed herbs back into the pot along with two teaspoons of turmeric, salt, and pepper to taste. Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients, about 8 cups, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for an hour. Add five dried limes (pierced with a fork) and 1 kg of soaked and drained red kidney beans, continuing to simmer for another 1-2 hours until the meat is tender and the beans are cooked. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Serve the Ghormeh Sabzi hot with steamed basmati rice."
