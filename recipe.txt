"To make a classic French omelet, start by cracking 3 large eggs into a bowl and beat them with a fork or whisk until well combined and slightly frothy, adding a pinch of salt and pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Once the butter is melted and starting to foam, pour in the eggs. Stir gently with a spatula, moving the eggs from the edges to the center, until they begin to set but are still slightly runny on top. At this point, you can add optional fillings such as finely chopped fresh herbs (like chives, parsley, or tarragon), grated cheese (such as Gruy\u00e8re or Cheddar), or saut\u00e9ed vegetables (like mushrooms, ham, or spinach). When the omelet is mostly set but still slightly creamy, fold it in half or thirds, slide it onto a plate, and serve immediately."
"To make Persian Kebab Koobideh for four people, start by combining 500 grams of ground beef and 500 grams of ground lamb in a large bowl, then add one finely grated onion, two minced garlic cloves, one teaspoon of salt, one teaspoon of ground black pepper, one teaspoon of ground turmeric, and half a teaspoon of sumac; mix thoroughly until all ingredients are well incorporated and the mixture becomes sticky. Cover the bowl and let the mixture rest in the refrigerator for at least one hour. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grates. Divide the meat mixture into eight equal portions and shape each portion into a long sausage-like form around flat metal skewers, pressing firmly to ensure the meat adheres to the skewers. Grill the kebabs for about 4-5 minutes on each side, turning them carefully to avoid sticking, until they are cooked through and have a nice char. Serve the kebabs hot with saffron rice, grilled tomatoes, fresh herbs, and flatbread."
"To make Persian Ghormeh Sabzi for ten people, start by washing and finely chopping four large bunches of parsley, two large bunches of cilantro, and one large bunch of fenugreek (or substitute with dried fenugreek leaves if fresh is unavailable), then set aside. In a large pot, heat 1/2 cup of vegetable oil over medium heat, add the herbs, and saut\u00e9 them for about 15-20 minutes, stirring frequently until they are dark green and aromatic. Remove the herbs from the pot and set aside. In the same pot, add 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and saut\u00e9 four large diced onions until golden brown. Add 2 kg of cubed beef or lamb, browning the meat on all sides. Then, add the saut\u00e9ed herbs back into the pot along with two teaspoons of turmeric, salt, and pepper to taste. Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients, about 8 cups, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for an hour. Add five dried limes (pierced with a fork) and 1 kg of soaked and drained red kidney beans, continuing to simmer for another 1-2 hours until the meat is tender and the beans are cooked. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. Serve the Ghormeh Sabzi hot with steamed basmati rice."
